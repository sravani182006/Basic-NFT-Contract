A simple and efficient NFT (Non-Fungible Token) smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain using the Move programming language. This contract provides essential NFT functionality including minting new tokens with metadata, transferring ownership, and managing NFT collections. The contract is designed to be lightweight, secure, and easy to understand, making it perfect for developers looking to implement basic NFT functionality in their Aptos-based applications.
